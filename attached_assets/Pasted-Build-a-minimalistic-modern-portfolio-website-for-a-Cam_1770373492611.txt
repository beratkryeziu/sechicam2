Build a minimalistic, modern portfolio website for a Camera Operator / Steadicam Operator.

STACK & REQUIREMENTS
- Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS.
- Minimal design, lots of whitespace, fast loading, responsive, accessible.
- No heavy animations. Subtle hover states only.
- SEO basics: titles, meta description, OpenGraph defaults.
- Content should be data-driven from a single file (e.g. /src/data/portfolio.ts) so I can edit films/videos without touching UI code.

SITE STRUCTURE
1) Home page (/)
   - Simple hero section: name, role (Camera Operator / Steadicam Operator), short one-liner.
   - Buttons/links: “View Work” (to /work) and “Contact” (to /contact).
   - Optional: small “Selected clients” line and a clean footer.

2) Work page (/work)
   - Header: “Work”
   - Filters/tabs with 3 categories:
     - Films
     - Commercials
     - Music Videos
   - Default active tab: Films.
   - Use URL state so tabs can be shared:
     - /work?category=films
     - /work?category=commercials
     - /work?category=music-videos

WORK CONTENT RULES
A) Films tab
- Display a grid of film “cards” with movie poster image.
- Each card shows: Title, Year (optional).
- Clicking a film opens a dedicated film detail page:
  - /work/films/[slug]
- Film detail page must include:
  - Large poster
  - Description paragraph(s)
  - Credit block with:
    - Camera Operator name
    - Steadicam Operator name (if different / optional)
  - Optional: external link(s) (IMDb, official site, trailer).

B) Commercials tab & Music Videos tab
- Show ONLY videos (no posters + long descriptions).
- Minimal organized grid with consistent thumbnails.
- Each video item supports embedding from:
  - YouTube
  - Vimeo
  - Instagram
- For performance, do NOT auto-load all iframes:
  - Show thumbnail with a play button overlay.
  - On click, replace thumbnail with the embedded player (iframe or Instagram embed).
- For Instagram embeds:
  - Support Reels/Post URLs.
  - Load Instagram embed script only when needed (lazy load).

CONTACT PAGE (/contact)
- Simple contact form: Name, Email, Message.
- Form validation (required fields, email format).
- On submit:
  - Option A: send via email using a server action (e.g. nodemailer) with environment variables
  - Option B: store submissions to a simple local JSON file for now
  - Implement Option A if possible; fallback to Option B with a clear note in code.
- Also show direct contact info blocks:
  - Email
  - Instagram/Vimeo links
  - Location (optional)

DESIGN SYSTEM
- Typography: clean sans font, large headings, compact labels.
- Colors: black/white/gray only.
- Components:
  - Navbar (Home / Work / Contact) with active state.
  - Footer with small copyright line.
  - Reusable Card, Tab/Filter, VideoThumbnail component.

DATA MODEL (single source of truth)
Create /src/data/portfolio.ts with structures like:
- films: { slug, title, year?, posterUrl, description, credits: { cameraOperator, steadicamOperator? }, links?[] }
- commercials: { title, platform: "youtube"|"vimeo"|"instagram", url, thumbnailUrl }
- musicVideos: { title, platform, url, thumbnailUrl }

SEED CONTENT
- Add 6 films (dummy titles + placeholder posters),
- Add 8 commercials,
- Add 8 music videos,
so the layout looks complete.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide full working code, run instructions, and ensure it builds with “npm run dev”.
- Keep everything minimal, clean, and well-structured.
